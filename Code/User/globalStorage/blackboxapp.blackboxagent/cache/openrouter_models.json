When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters."},"nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-70b":{"maxTokens":131000,"contextWindow":131000,"supportsImages":false,"supportsPromptCache":false,"inputPrice":0.12,"outputPrice":0.3,"description":"Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over [Hermes 2](/models/nousresearch/nous-hermes-2-mistral-7b-dpo), including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.\n\nHermes 3 70B is a competitive, if not superior finetune of the [Llama-3.1 70B foundation model](/models/meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct), focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.\n\nThe Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities, including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities, generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills."},"nousresearch/hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b":{"maxTokens":131000,"contextWindow":131000,"supportsImages":false,"supportsPromptCache":false,"inputPrice":0.7999999999999999,"outputPrice":0.7999999999999999,"description":"Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.\n\nHermes 3 405B is a frontier-level, full-parameter finetune of the Llama-3.1 405B foundation model, focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.\n\nThe Hermes 3 series builds and expands on the Hermes 2 set of capabilities, including more powerful and reliable function calling and structured output capabilities, generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills.\n\nHermes 3 is competitive, if not superior, to Llama-3.1 Instruct models at general capabilities, with varying strengths and weaknesses attributable between the two."},"perplexity/llama-3.1-sonar-huge-128k-online":{"maxTokens":null,"contextWindow":127072,"supportsImages":false,"supportsPromptCache":false,"inputPrice":5,"outputPrice":5,"description":"Llama 3.1 Sonar is Perplexity's latest model family.
